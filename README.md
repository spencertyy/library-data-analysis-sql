# Library Data Analysis with SQL

## Overview

This repository presents a **SQL-based data analysis project** built on a
relational **library management database**.  
The project focuses on translating **relational algebra concepts** into
practical **SQL analytical queries**, emphasizing clear query logic,
schema design, and business-oriented insights.

Rather than serving as simple SQL practice, this repository demonstrates
how relational database theory is applied to real-world **data analysis
and reporting scenarios**.

---

## Key Topics Covered

- Relational algebra operators and their SQL equivalents
- Relational schema design and primary/foreign keys
- Multi-table joins and data retrieval strategies
- Analytical aggregation and filtering patterns
- Customer behavior and loyalty analysis
- Query optimization and indexing concepts

---

## Project Structure

This repository is organized as a set of focused analytical documents:

- **Relational Query Operators Reference**  
  Core relational algebra operators mapped to SQL syntax with analytical use cases.

- **Schema Design and Keys**  
  Relational modeling concepts including keys, relationships, and normalization.

- **SQL Data Retrieval and Joins**  
  Practical examples of joins, filters, and multi-table queries.

- **Customer Loyalty Analysis**  
  Analytical queries that classify customers based on usage behavior.

- **Query Optimization and Index Design**  
  Discussion of performance considerations and query efficiency.

Each document is written to be **self-contained** and readable independently.

## Technologies Used

- **SQL** (relational queries, joins, aggregation)
- **Relational Algebra** (conceptual query reasoning)
- **Markdown** (technical documentation)

---

## Analytical Focus

This project emphasizes:

- Translating abstract database theory into concrete SQL queries
- Writing readable, maintainable analytical SQL
- Thinking in terms of **business questions**, not just syntax
- Understanding how database design impacts query performance

---

## Intended Audience

This repository is relevant for:

- Data Analyst / Junior Data Analyst roles
- Analytics Engineer roles
- Software Engineers working with data-intensive systems
- Students transitioning from database theory to applied analytics

## Notes

All data structures and examples are designed for educational and
demonstration purposes, focusing on analytical reasoning rather than
production deployment.
